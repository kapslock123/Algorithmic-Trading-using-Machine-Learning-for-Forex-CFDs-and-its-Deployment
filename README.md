# Algorithmic-Trading-using-Machine-Learning-for-Forex-CFDs-and-its-Deployment
The rise of expert advisors in the market has  significantly transformed the trading environment. The  market's efficiency has risen as a result of its widespread  acceptance. Foreign currency markets, in particular, have  grown very efficient, leaving little to no room for conventional  investors to stand in the game. The price of a financial  instrument adapts quickly in response to fresh public  information. With the introduction of Technical Indicators,  which give a variety of use cases such as anticipating the trend  in the market as well as the strength of the trend, its adoption  has grown, and many algorithmic traders have begun to employ  it. Because of the high number of transactions that might result  from the use of technical indicators, using them alone is  insufficient and unproductive. To make better use of it, more  and more models based on machine learning are being  developed, including technical indications as features. I will try  back-testing machine learning-based models to anticipate  instrument price trends and deploy them using an API offered  by one of the interactive brokers.
